#| Language M0
   ===========

 M0 is really a language and standard library: the language is essentially an extension of L0,
  that macro-compiles to L0, along with a small standard library written in that language.

 M0 is meant to be for humans to write programs in, so we won't tag it.

 There are seventeen kinds of expression, corresponding to the provides of the form ‘T:<id>’ above.
 For each of those, except T:*id*, T:*datum*, and T:*app*, there's an M0 expression (<id> <part> ...).

 Function application is then any other expression of the form: (<part> ...).
   During expansion, the macro system turns that into (*app* <id>), for T:*app* to transform.

 A simple identifier is an M0 expression meaning variable access.
   During expansion, the macro system turns that into (*id* <id>), for T:*id* to transform.

 An integer is an M0 expression meaning a constant.
  During expansion, the macro system turns that into (*datum* <id>), for T:*datum* to transform.

 It's assumed that M0 programmers will not use identifiers surrounded by asterisks. |#

; An M0 expression:
#;(λ (f a b)
    (set! a b)
    (f a 488))
; During expansion, when some parts of that are expanded, they'll be treated as if that was:
#;(λ (f a b)
    (set! a (*id* b))
    (*app* (*id* f) (*id* a) (*datum* 488)))

#| Compiling M0 to L0
   ==================

 Implement:

   1. The transformers mentioned in the ‘provide’ above, for the forms described below.

   2. The standard library, which is a function that attaches the library to an expression,
       described at the end of this file.

 Each transformer ‘T:<id>’ transforms code of the form ‘(<id> <e> ...)’.

 In the given patterns:
   ‘...’  means zero or more of the previous component
   ‘...+’ means one  or more of the previous component

 Other than T:*id*, T:*datum*, T:set!, T:*if*, T:*λ*, and T:*app*, transformers should not
  directly produce L0 forms.

 New identifiers introduced by transformations
 ---------------------------------------------
 In some of your templates you will find that you need to make up the name of an identifier.

 For new “dummy” identifiers that aren't referenced, use ‘_’.
   • we'll assume that user code does not reference any identifier with that name either

 For temporary identifiers that are referenced, use an identifier of the form "*<id>*",
  i.e. surrounded by asterisks. But don't use the names ‘*app*’, ‘*id*’, nor ‘*datum*’.
   • it will be assumed that user code does not use such identifiers |#

; *id* *datum* set! if
; --------------------
; The following two special cases should expand to integers 0 and 1:
#;(*id* false)
#;(*id* true)
; Otherwise, they are straightforward untagged versions of L0 expressions.
; Transform those directly to their L0 form.

;
; Transform within the M0 language by wrapping the body in a ‘block’,

;  and currying if there are two or more parameters.

;
; Transform the form with no expressions to the integer 0.
; Transform the form with one expression to just the expression.
; Transform the form with more than one expression to a ‘let’ naming the first expression
;  with a dummy variable.
;
; For other M0 forms that need dummy values [e.g. as mentioned for *app*], use (block) for
;  the dummy value.
